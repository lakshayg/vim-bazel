INTRODUCTION                                *bazel* *compiler-bazel*

This plugin essentially provides a bazel |compiler| plugin and some plumbing
around it to handle bazel quirks and make it work nicely with vim.

Note: The compiler plugin is set to recognize gcc / clang error messages and
will not be very useful for other programming languages in its current state.

COMMANDS                                    *bazel-commands*

                                            *bazel-:Bazel* *:Bazel*
:Bazel build [targets]  These commands are the only reason to use this plugin.
:Bazel test  [targets]  They activate the bazel compiler plugin and forward to
                        `:make`. [targets] are the bazel targets to build / test
                        and can be auto-completed using the <Tab> key. If left
                        unspecified, the plugin tries to determine the target
                        for the current buffer using a bazel query. When the
                        current buffer is a BUILD file, all the targets in the
                        file are built / tested.

                                            *bazel-:Bld*
:Bld                    Jumps to the BUILD file for the current buffer.

VARIABLES                                   *bazel-variables*

                                            *bazel-g:bazel_bash_completion_path*
g:bazel_bash_completion_path  The plugin uses the bazel bash completion script
                        for target completions. If the script is not found in
                        its usual locations, the user can locate it manually &
                        set this variable to the full path of the script. See:
                        https://bazel.build/install/completion

                                            *bazel-g:bazel_make_command*
g:bazel_make_command    This plugin can be used with async plugins to run
                        bazel asynchronously. This variable must be set to
                        the `:make` replacement provided by the async plugin.
                        Here are some examples:

>
                        tpope/vim-dispatch       => "Make"
                        skywind3000/asyncrun.vim => "AsyncRun -program=make"
                        hauleth/asyncdo.vim      => "AsyncDo bazel"
