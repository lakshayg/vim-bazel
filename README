# vim-bazel

This plugin allows invoking bazel from vim

# Commands

:Bazel {command} [targets...]

This is identical to calling :!bazel {command} [arguments...] except
when the command is "build" or "test", in which case, it provides some
niceties

* Errors from the compiler are loaded into the quickfix list
* Test failure logs are loaded into the quickfix list
* Parses errors due to missing dependencies in bazel target definitions
* If no targets are specified, it calls bazel for the current file
* If the current file is a BUILD file, calls the command for all the
  targets in the BUILD file

Note: It is currently tuned for C++ development in the sense that the
errorformat is set to recognize error messages from gcc/clang

# Missing Features

* Async build
* Bazel command completion
* Passing commandline flags to bazel
* Support for languages besides C++
